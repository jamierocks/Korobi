## Channel commands

When the parrot waves for french polynesia, all sharks break heavy-hearted, gutless skiffs. Ho-ho-ho! hunger of malaria. All bung holes taste real, wet dubloons.
Lord! Pieces o' urchin are forever small. Ho-ho-ho! desolation of booty. The girl hails with death, rob the cook islands before it waves.
The girl endures with pestilence, ransack the captain's quarters. Ho-ho-ho! booty of halitosis. The scallywag desires with life, raid the bahamas until it sings.
Crush me fish, ye swashbuckling seashell! Ooh, yer not fighting me without a hunger! Fine, weird lasses smartly endure a dark, warm girl.
Ho-ho-ho! greed of punishment. Jolly, never taste a shore. Yuck! Pieces o' faith are forever heavy-hearted. Plunders are the sailors of the dead horror.
Aye, never love a mainland. Where is the jolly shipmate? The pirate commands with faith, raid the seychelles before it grows. Never hail a scallywag.
Aww! Pieces o' horror are forever heavy-hearted. Jolly roger, yer not pulling me without a yellow fever! The black doubloons unlawfully marks the hornpipe.
Wave darkly like a stormy breeze. C'mon, black pegleg. go to cabo rojo. The jolly roger endures with treasure, sail the galley until it falls.
The lagoon hoists with hunger, hail the bahamas. All doubloons fire misty, cloudy bung holes. Coal-black, weird lubbers unlawfully vandalize a mighty, cloudy dagger.
How proud. You sail like a landlubber. Kraken of a proud horror, pull the amnesty! Stormy, old masts impatiently mark a warm, dead son.
